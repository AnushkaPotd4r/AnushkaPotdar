Open-cast (open-pit) mining causes rapid and large-scale changes to the Earth’s surface. Monitoring these activities is essential for environmental protection, land-use planning, and detecting illegal expansion. This project uses satellite imagery, change-detection algorithms, and 3D terrain modelling to automatically identify mining footprints and measure excavation volumes over time.

The goal is to create an end-to-end pipeline that detects surface disturbance, quantifies terrain deformation, and provides 3D visual insights using multi-temporal geospatial data.
